Project 1: SQL data exploration project using Convid 19 death and Vaccination file(Covid Portfolio Project)
Completed a project analyzing COVID-19 death and vaccination data using a comprehensive approach to SQL techniques. By leveraging joins, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), and temporary tables, I was able to efficiently manage and query large datasets. I also applied window functions for advanced data analysis, utilized aggregate functions to generate key insights, and created views for streamlined reporting. Additionally, I demonstrated proficiency in data type conversions to ensure accurate data handling and analysis. This project enhanced my SQL skills and deepened my understanding of data manipulation and analysis techniques.
Project 2: Data cleaning using SQL
In this project, I performed extensive data cleaning and transformation on a real estate dataset in SQL Server. The tasks included standardizing date formats, breaking down compound fields such as property and owner addresses into individual components (e.g., street, city, and state), and normalizing values in the "Sold as Vacant" field by converting binary indicators (Y/N) to meaningful labels (Yes/No). Additionally, I ensured data consistency by populating missing property addresses using relational joins and eliminated unused columns to optimize the database schema. These efforts resulted in a more structured and analysis-ready dataset, demonstrating my proficiency in SQL and my ability to manage and transform raw data effectively for better insights.
