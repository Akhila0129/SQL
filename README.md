Project 1: SQL data exploration project using Convid 19 death and Vaccination file(Covid Portfolio Project)
Completed a project analyzing COVID-19 death and vaccination data using a comprehensive approach to SQL techniques. By leveraging joins, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), and temporary tables, I was able to efficiently manage and query large datasets. I also applied window functions for advanced data analysis, utilized aggregate functions to generate key insights, and created views for streamlined reporting. Additionally, I demonstrated proficiency in data type conversions to ensure accurate data handling and analysis. This project enhanced my SQL skills and deepened my understanding of data manipulation and analysis techniques.
